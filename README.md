Learning about Heroku, Postgres, and Express! Wanted to make a blog site for fun.
Two big pains so far: Figuring out Postgres. I've only used MySQL. They seem like the same thing but setting Postgres up, I went through all the same headaches as previous DBs I've used.
NPM. UGHHHHH I had so many problems with npm. I kept having path's set to User instead of sudo/global, whatever that means. Installed NVM and so far it's working beautifully and easy!
